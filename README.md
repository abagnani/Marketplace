# Marketplace

Our project is a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers. Sellers can list items of various categories and include descriptive information about the item. Buyers can view items and interact with items they wish to purchase.

For iteration 1, we focused on the seller side of our marketplace. We created an interface for an Item, classes for specific Item types that implement the Item interface, and an ItemManager for sellers to keep track of their Items. Specifcally, we completed the following user stories:
- A seller should be able to post items of a specific category
- A seller should be able to post clothing items
- A seller should be able to post food items
- A seller should be able to post electronic items
- A seller should be able to post furniture items
- A seller should be able to view all their existing item postings

We believe everything we implemented currently works.

For iteration 2, we plan to begin creating objects for buyers to view and interact with the Items. Specifically, we plan to complete the following user stories:
- A buyer should be able to search items for sale by category
- A buyer should be able to favorite an item to view later
- A buyer should be get the contact information of the seller of the item they want to purchase
